# 10-Popular-Java-Programming-Idioms-to-write-better-code
These are all excellent Java programming idioms that can help developers write better and more efficient code. By following these best practices, you can improve the readability, maintainability, and performance of your Java applications.

To recap, some of the popular Java programming idioms include using interfaces wherever possible, leveraging the power of enums to create singletons, checking wait() conditions in loops, using entrySet to loop over HashMaps, and closing streams in their own try block.

It's also important to use appropriate interfaces like Collection or List when defining method return types or argument types, use Iterator to traverse lists instead of for loops with get() methods, use Arrays.asList() or List.of() to initialize collections, and write code with Dependency Injection in mind to make your classes testable and modular.

By incorporating these best practices into your Java programming workflow, you can become a more efficient and effective developer while creating more robust and reliable software.

1. Calling equals() on String literals or known objects:

This helps prevent potential NullPointerException by invoking equals() on the known object instead of the variable.
2. Using entrySet() to loop over HashMap:

Instead of using the key set, iterating over the entry set allows direct access to both keys and values, improving efficiency.

3. Using Enum as Singleton:

Declaring a singleton using the Enum type ensures thread safety, robustness, and guarantees a single instance even during serialization and deserialization.

4. Using Arrays.asList() or List.of() to initialize collections:

These idioms provide a concise way to initialize lists or sets with values, avoiding repetitive add() calls.

5.Checking wait() conditions in a loop:

When using inter-thread communication with wait() and notify(), it's important to check the waiting condition in a loop to handle spurious notifications..

6. Catching CloneNotSupportedException and returning a subclass instance:

When implementing the clone() method, catching CloneNotSupportedException is unnecessary, as it will never be thrown for classes that implement the Cloneable interface. Also, returning a subtype helps reduce the need for explicit casting.

7. Using interfaces wherever possible:

Favoring interface types over concrete classes in method signatures, return types, and variable types allows for flexibility and easier swapping of implementations.

8. Using Iterator to traverse lists:

Iterating over lists using an Iterator is a safer approach, as it supports various implementations (e.g., LinkedList) and avoids potential issues with multi-threading.

9. Writing code with Dependency Injection in mind:

Designing classes with dependency injection (passing dependencies through constructors) promotes loose coupling and makes the code easier to test and maintain.

10. Closing streams in their own try block or using try-with-resources:

Streams should be closed in separate try blocks or, even better, using the try-with-resources statement, which automatically closes the resources after use.
These idioms contribute to writing cleaner, more efficient, and maintainable Java code. However, it's essential to consider the specific context and requirements of your project when applying them.
